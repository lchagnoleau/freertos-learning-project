# freertos-learning-project üìö


## 1. Introduction üöÄ

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for FreeRTOS in a C++ environment using the STM32F103RB microcontroller.
FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system kernel that allows for multitasking, task scheduling, and resource management.
By working with the STM32F103RB microcontroller, this project offers an opportunity to understand the integration of FreeRTOS with a specific hardware platform.
Through practical examples and exercises, developers can gain a deeper understanding of real-time systems and enhance their skills in embedded software development.

## 2. Folder Structure üìÅ

I choose the following folder structure for this project:

- `CMakeLists.txt`: The main CMake configuration file for the project.
- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the project.
    - `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the application.
    - `freertos/`: Contains the FreeRTOS specific code.
        - `tasks/`: Contains the task implementation files.
        - `drivers/`: Contains the driver implementation files.
        - `utils/`: Contains utility functions and helpers.
    - `stm32f103rb/`: Contains the STM32F103RB specific code.
        - `peripherals/`: Contains the peripheral driver implementation files.
        - `startup/`: Contains the startup code files.
- `build/`: Contains the build output files (generated by CMake).
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation and user guides.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the project.

This folder structure provides a clear separation of concerns and allows for easy navigation and maintenance of the project files.
