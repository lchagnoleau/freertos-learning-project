# freertos-learning-project üìö


## 1. Introduction üöÄ

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for FreeRTOS in a C++ environment using the STM32F103RB microcontroller.
FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system kernel that allows for multitasking, task scheduling, and resource management.
By working with the STM32F103RB microcontroller, this project offers an opportunity to understand the integration of FreeRTOS with a specific hardware platform.
Through practical examples and exercises, developers can gain a deeper understanding of real-time systems and enhance their skills in embedded software development.
